# A10 Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

1.	Ok. We were redirected (in some way) to

		http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex13-task.php

	Let's take a look at the link for Level 13 in the levels' dropdown list

		http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex13.php?redirect=ex13-task.php

	Interesting!!! The redirect is performed by using `redirect` parameter.

2.	Let's try with

		http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex13.php?redirect=http://mysite.com

	For sure, we receive

		Bad Redirect Parameter

	Maybe the approach of [Level 4](./ex4md)...

		http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex13.php?redirect=HtTp://mysite.com
		                                                                 ^^^^
	Grrr...

		Bad Redirect Parameter

	Let's try with

		http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex13.php?redirect=ftp://mysite.com
		                                                                 ^^^

	Ops... No error message! Seems that value of `redirect` is validated by
	using a case-insensitive `regex`.

2.	By Googling I found the man page of the PHP function
	[`parse_url()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php). If you take
	a look at `Example #2`, you can see that URLs may be also specified without
	the scheme.

3.	Let's try this

		http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex13.php?redirect=//mysite.com
		                                                                 ^^

	Yep!

		Congratulations, you just completed the last level. You are a true Ninja warrior now.
