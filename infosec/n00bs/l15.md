# Procedure

1.  By inserting `google.com` the result seems to be a standard Dig output.

2.  Let's try to insert `-h` option... It works! (the man page is shown)

3.  Let's try to insert `; ls -al`. If correct, at server side it should be
    equivalent to

        $ dig; ls -al

4.  Yep! Directory listing works! Moreover, a suspect file named `.hey` is
	present.

5.  Download it

        $ wget http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/levelfifteen/.hey
        $ cat .hey
        Miux+mT6Kkcx+IhyMjTFnxT6KjAa+i6ZLibC

6.  Should `ZLibC` be a hint? I'm still working on it... Grrr...

7.  Meanwhile (I'm curious), let's try take a look in the file system...

8.  Wow! In `/misc` there is the `readme.wav` file (never used in past levels).
    By hearing it, seems to be newly a Morse code
    
        .. -. ..-. --- ... . -.-. ..-. .-.. .- --. .. ... -- --- .-. ... . -.-. --- -.. . - --- -. . ...

9.  Decode it

        .. -. ..-. --- ... . -.-. ..-. .-.. .- --. .. ... -- --- .-. ... . -.-. --- -.. . - --- -. . ...

10. After spending many time by trying several combinations of ZLib and GZip
    headers, I realised that ZLibC is a decoy!!! Let's try to decrypt it by
    trying several methods...

11. Googling on the web, I found this interesting web site

        http://crypo.in.ua/tools/

    that offers several encryption/decryption for many algorithms

12. After trying (without success) popular encryptors, I started with fastest
    encryptors and with `ATOM 128`... BINGO!!!
